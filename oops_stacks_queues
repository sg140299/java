IN OOPS:
Noun : Class
Adjective : Data Member
Verb : Functions

STACK - LIFO  Insert- O(1)  Delete - O(1) 
QUEUE - FIFO  Insert- O(1)  Delete - O(1)

Class is a blueprint, 

class_name obj=new class_name();   //obj is a reference pointing to an object.
Objects are created in heap memory.
Refrence of obj is stored in stack memory.
Dot operator is used to print the properties.

Acess Specifiers :
1 Private : Visible inside same class.
2 Public  : Visible Everywhere.
3 Default : Visible inside same package.

this keyword is used in java to acess the current objet attribute.

Constructor 
  It is used to initialize the instance variables of a particular object.
  Have no return type not even void.
  They are of the same name as that of the class.
  Look like function only.
  
  
Throws exception 

public void setname(String name) throws Exception{
  if(name.equals("") || name==null){
    throw new Exception("This is an exception")
    } 
    this.name=name;
 }

Static and final keyword

static means it belong to the class not to object it means that if its value changes further then it reflects in each and every object.
static function can only access static data members not access instance variables, this can't be used with static function as well as static variable
A non-static function can access both static as well as non-static variables
Acessing static var :  class_name.attribute   
final means its value set once not change further.(can be public)

Array of objects:
class_name[] name=new class_name[1000];
for(int i=0;i<name.length;i++){
  name[i]=new class_name();


Exception Handling

You have to declare both calling and called function as dangerous both.
Exception canbe handled through try/catch.

Inside try write dangerous function
try{
s1.setage(-10);//after statements not executed if error comes
}
catch(Exception e){
syso("In catch");//after statemets are executed
}
